### Reference Documentation

* To get started, clone the repository into your IDEA of preference.

##Important
In the resources folder there is a postman file where you have all the endpoint queries

### Guides

Next I will mention the "endpoints" developed, their functions and how to test them in case there are problems with the posman file.

                "room": 36.0
        }
        }

##Test

You can run the "all Test" with coverage ignoring the following classes and packages:
            
    desafio2.testing.domian.*
    desafio2.testing.exception.*
    desafio2.testing.service.tdo.*
    desafio2.testing.util.*
    desafio2.testing.TestingApplication
    desafio2.testing.controller.HandlerExceptionController

The answer you should give is 100% of the classes, 100% of the methods, and 97% of the lines tested.
